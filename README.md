# Key Driver Reports

## Moffitt Cancer Center - Patient Experience Department

### Overview

Moffitt's KPI for patient experience is the survey response to the question "Likelihood to Recommend the Facility." The proportion of top box (5 out of 5 on a Likert scale) scores is used for incentives and organization goal setting.

Press Ganey's Key Driver Reports historically sends reports for the service line on an annual basis. Press Ganey's methodology has been employed to generate key driver reports when required at the service line, clinic, and provider levels.

Correlation, top box ratio, and percentile rank (internal) are used to calculate a priority index, which is used to generate the top ten key drivers.
